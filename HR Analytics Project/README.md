## KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPIs)
* Attrition Rate: The overall attrition rate of 16% is prominently displayed, indicating it is a critical KPI for measuring employee turnover.
* Attrition Count: The total number of employees who have left the company (237) is shown as the "Attrition Count", which is another important workforce metric.
* Active Employees: The number of currently active employees (1233) is highlighted, likely serving as a KPI for tracking the current workforce size.
* Job Satisfaction Rating: A job satisfaction rating of 2.6 (out of 5) is provided, suggesting it is used as a KPI to gauge employee engagement and satisfaction levels.
* Attrition by Job Role: The attrition breakdown by different job roles like Sales Executive, Research Scientist, etc., is presented, indicating it is a relevant KPI for identifying high-turnover roles.
* Attrition by Age Group: The attrition rates across different age groups (e.g., 25-34, 35-44) are shown, suggesting it is a KPI for monitoring age-related attrition patterns.
* Attrition by Marital Status: The attrition levels based on marital status (Single, Married, Divorced) are displayed, implying it is a KPI for understanding the impact of marital status on turnover.
* Attrition by Education Level: The attrition count based on education levels like Bachelor's Degree, Master's Degree, etc., is presented, indicating it is a KPI for analyzing the role of education in attrition.
* Department-wise Attrition: The attrition breakdown by departments (HR, R&D, Sales) is shown, suggesting it is a KPI for identifying high-turnover departments.

## KEY INSIGHTS
* High Attrition Rate: The company has a relatively high overall attrition rate of 16%, which could be a cause for concern and may indicate issues with employee retention.
* Education Level and Attrition: Employees with higher levels of education, such as those with Bachelor's and Master's degrees, have higher attrition rates compared to those with Associate's degrees, high school diplomas, or Doctoral degrees. This could suggest dissatisfaction or better job opportunities for more educated employees.
* Department and Attrition: The Sales department has the highest attrition rate at 56.12%, followed by R&D at 38.82%. These departments may require focused retention strategies to address the underlying issues contributing to high attrition.
* Age Group and Attrition: The highest attrition rate is observed in the 25-34 age group (112.0), indicating that younger employees are more likely to leave the company. This could be due to factors such as better job opportunities, career growth, or work-life balance concerns.
* Marital Status and Attrition: Single employees have the highest attrition rate (673) compared to married (470) and divorced (327) employees. This could be related to different life stages and priorities among different marital status groups.
* Average Age and Job Satisfaction: The average age of employees is 37, and the job satisfaction rating is 2.6 (out of 5), which could be considered relatively low. This may indicate areas for improvement in employee engagement, career growth opportunities, or work culture.

## RECOMMENDATIONS
* Implement a comprehensive exit interview process to understand the root causes of attrition, especially in departments and job roles with high turnover rates (e.g., Sales, R&D, Sales Executives, Research Scientists).
* Identify and implement targeted retention strategies which include offering competitive compensation packages, career advancement opportunities, training and development programs.
* Address the relatively low job satisfaction rating (2.6 out of 5) by enhancing employee engagement initiatives. This could involve improving communication, recognition programs, work culture, and opportunities for feedback and collaboration.
* Analyze the factors contributing to the high attrition rate among the 25-34 age group. This may involve revisiting policies related to work flexibility, career growth opportunities, compensation etc.
